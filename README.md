# Software-Security-Artemis-Financial-
Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to add a file verification to their web appliaction to ensure secure communications. They want transfer data to be verified in a form of a checksum. I did well in generating that check sum and getting the mapping to work for the website. I was able to generate the certificates but was not able to fully secure the site. It is important to code securely so that you and the client are not effected by hacking from outside parties gaining access to sensitive information. Software security is a large part of a company's success. The more the secure the company is, the less likely they will get hacked. The part of the vulnerability assessment that was challeging for me was determine false postives. I understand that it is the process of making messages go away that we know that we do not have a fix to. I increased layers of security by adding a check sum verification and a self signed certificate. In the future I wll use a dependency check report to help identify vulnerabilities with the code. This process was difficult at first but gets much easier the more you practice. I made certaing the code and software application were functional by testing the program and making sure that the regactored code and all the layers of security I put in place worked. For future employers, I would show them the dependency check report and check sum verification.
